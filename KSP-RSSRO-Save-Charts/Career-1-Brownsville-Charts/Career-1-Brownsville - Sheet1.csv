1966 Oct 16,2024 Apr 6,Goliath 4C,Selenium 3B,Geostationary Communications Network Launch 2,,Success,"Forgot about the second stage avionics issue, 222x349km parking orbit, above indian ocean. Drifted to Africa before correction to 23:56:04 orbital period. Solar panels began to fail in mid 1968"
1966 Dec 6,2024 Apr 6,Colussus 2 SRH-10,Amundsen 3,Mars Flyby & Orbiter,,Success,"Added tank on pad to hit minimum mass requirement, revert to try better trajectory for orbital insertion, perfect second stage, 1 engine out on third stage, performance loss (ISP) on TMI stage at 260s, ~700m/s trajectory correction to make up for performance loss. 292 days in, perfect Mars Orbit Insertion into an 86 degree orbit. 40% RCS prop remaining"
1967 Feb 22,2024 Aug 15,Colussus 2 BNH-15,Polaris 1,Crewed Lunar Flyby,Achim Hahn,Success,"First manned spaceflight in 973 days! First play in 131 days. One center non-gimbaling engine out at 55 seconds, max 12Gs on ascent. Opps did 2 RL-10 upper stage burns to get into orbit, didn't wait until burn t- = 0, 3500m/s remaining in LEO. 3120m/s TLI burn, extremely efficient, ~300km parking orbit. 2 days 18 hours close approach. 180m/s correction to adjust landing location and get into the atmosphere, could've been lower but landing location was moved from Indonesia to off the coast of north Peru. 14Gs peak reentry. Return Mar 1 6:43pm after 6 days 16 hours."
1967 May 13,2024 Aug 15,Goliath 4C,Selenium 3C & 3D,Geostationary Communications Network Launch 3,,Partial Success,"Error launching at 150t pad, would go back to menu, launched from 700t. Error with contract, so this is technically the geostationary test satellite contract. Spin at end of first stage booster burn because of 10x physics warp, corrected by LR-91 preburner exhaust gimbaling. Flourine 3rd stage got to 60x270 km orbit. The GEO insertion burn was delayed to get better positioning relative to 3A&3B sats, this evaporated too much hydrogen & lox to put both sats in GEO, one was abandoned in GTO. 4g GEO insertion burn. Selenium 3D at 2.4 degree inclination. Selenium 3D fully positioned over Texas in mid June."
1967 Jun 7,2024 Aug 17,Goliath 4D,Amundsen 4,Venus Orbital Science Probe,,Success,"Goliath OLC launch pad didn't have enough payloads for it, so this contact was undertaken. Construction of this vehicle prioritized over Selenium 3C/D to make the transfer window to Venus, rushed mission. Launched into clouds, beautiful. 213x2350 km parking orbit. Extra 600m/s on Venus transfer, 500m/s extra used for higher parking orbit, 100m/s net. Perfect transfer straight from Earth, no mid course correction required. Perfect 1000m/s insertion into 820 x 56361 km orbit"
1967 Jul 9,2024 Aug 17,Colussus 2 BRH-18,Polaris 2,First Crewed Lunar Orbit,Wladislaw Statnik,Partial Failure,"First window launched too early FUCK, reset for another launch in 2 weeks! Achim was still recovered from Polaris 1, so new Astronaut recruited. Single LR-91 engine out on second stage. Two RL-10s collided during staging of the third stage, then went into a spin, capsule & AJ10 service module separated and ignited the AJ10 engine to test, the RCS corrected the spin and got back on course. The service module had enough delta V to get into orbit, this was done to test the engine and gain data. Initial 205x212 parking orbit with 900m/s, then boosted to 206x3345km with 200m/s left. One extra orbit taken before return to test radiation around the Van Allen belts, 3% radiation exposure total. A little under 2 thirds RCS prop left, tons to spare, used 20 units of HTP. 45 km pe for entry, perfect return, Statnik came home safe far east of Hawaii. To correct the engine collision issue, staging must be delayed."
1967 Jul 21,2024 Aug 17,Goliath 4AH,Polaris Storage Test,Polaris Storage Test,,Great Success,"Testing Long-term Hydrolox storage in space and docking (with the Ricochet 4E target vehicle) for the human landing mission. After a perfect ascent, the probe was set to debris erroneously, corrected this within a minute. First 26 hours, lost 0.5%. 0.25kg/hr. Lesson 1: Maneuvering engines required for docking, maybe 100m/s worth. DOCKING SUCCESSFUL! A great technological milestone for the Polaris program. 3.23 LH2 on July 23 9 am. Lesson 2: Having mass in the way of the sun matters a lot, need shade! Aug 4, 3.14 LH2. -0.09/12/3.23 = 0.25% per day. Looks like you can 100% eliminate it if you get enough shade. Sep 30, 1.26 kL LH2, 1% per day."
1967 Oct 26,2024 Aug 18,Colussus 2 BRH-18,Polaris 3,First Crewed Lunar Orbit,Achim Hahn,Success,"Launch a few hours before sunrise, another LR-91 failure. 3120m/s in 302x174 km parking orbit. 66 Hours to Moon. ~1150m/s TEI burn. 20m/s left, super close, very uncomfortable. Night time reentry, 6 days 20 hours to get back. Peak 15g's, took a couple attempts to do reentry due to KSP crashes, ended up doing only from map view"
1968 Feb 24,2024 Aug 21,Goliath 4A,Heinlein 20,Lunar Relay Satellites,,Partial Success,"204x1995 parking orbit. Perfect launch window, try to be too early! dV somehow miscalculated on TLI stage (not caught in testing), have to use LV 3rd stage. Second Probe used as kick stage, extra 140m/s on top probe to finalize TLI burn. 2-ton payload capacity on the relays saved the mission. First relay left in 690x156,000 km Earth orbit, ~8 day orbital period. 60m/s left on lunar relay. Relay not put in frozen orbit, but at 25000x18000 km it won't be going anywhere."
1968 Apr 4,2024 Aug 21,Goliath 4D,Polaris 4,First EVA / First Rendezvous / Polaris Capsule LEO Test,"Roman Nesterov, Sally Robinson",Great Success,"Training accelerated by 6 months or more for all Kerbals, still the long lead item regardless. Targetting Humboldt-4B, first object in orbit. 1.65 TWR at liftoff. 155x258 km parking orbit, 11:20 to orbit. On 5.5th orbit at 7:40 into the mission at 730m/s relative velocity, at t-40 (29km separation) seconds to closest approach, the engine ignited. Fly by at 470m/s until zero relative velocity occured at 14km. Required far more fuel to null relative velocity than expected, had 200m/s left over. Difficult mission for first crewed docking! Successful rendezvous at 70m, no EVA jetpack so the crew stayed on the capsule. Docking adapter jettisioned to save weight, got ~30m/s extra. After 12 hours, crossing the van allen belts often, we got to 5% radiation exposure. Not going to make it to 14 days to complete a quaternary objective. 6.5% radiation by 20:27 at deorbit burn, 38.8km away from Humboldt 4B before burn. Engine failure at deorbit, f9 recovery, then in ""to-death"" testing before reentry, learned that an emergency deorbit backup is required. Landing in the gulf west of florida. 3 Contracts completed, EVA, Rendezvous, 2 crew record."
1968 Aug 5,2024 Aug 23,Goliath 4D,Polaris 5,First Docking / 14 Day Crew Record / Long-term Polaris Capsule test,Derek Anderson,Success,"To accelerate construction of the pad for the P6 Mini Tanker, I didn't wait for more than 1 crew member to be trained. Final orbit circlurization was off cource at first because a spin began after 3rd stage sep, RCS fixed this. 1000m/s left when in orbit, inefficient final trajectory. At 2:18 d:h, close approach at 170m/s 2km away. More RCS Prop required. Successful docking, the comms antenna is not in the way. Completed 2 dockings & Transfered RCS Prop into spacecraft. Took a long time to do <100m docking and multiple burns, need monoprop thrusters w/ ~200m/s for this (+ deorbit). At 514km, crossing into the inner van allen belts, still 0% radiation. Not enough Oxygen for a 30 day mission (by ~1 day), so deorbiting after 14. Back after 15 days 20 hours. Peak 9G's, Missed landing site by 450km, trajectories mod was wrong."
1968 Nov 22 08:30,2025 Jul 21,Colussus 2 BHH-23,Polaris 6 Escape Stage,First Human Moon Landing,,Success,"Using the EOR-LOR approach accelerated the human landing by ~9 months, immensely complex though and we don't have enough MLI layers.          Rolling out Tanker to 700t pad, crew right behind to launch directly after the 3 day launch cooldown, Escape stage from Brownsville 150t pad (physically, not literally). Imagine those two vehicles actually on the mobile launch platforms one after the one, beautiful shot it would be.           TLI is 3 days, Crew launches 3 days after fuel, add an extra day or two. Launch 8 days before the Moon reaches the descending/ascending node.             No fuel transfer tube on the right booster, strange. Burn boosters longer than core and keep them attached.        247x287 km orbit, 2.5 degrees relative to Moon. 43.2 kL LH2.          With a vehicle rolled out, you don't need to wait for launch pad cooldown (3 days)."
1968 Nov 23 08:26,2025 Jul 21,Colussus 2 BHH-23,Polaris 6 Tanker,First Human Moon Landing,,Success,"No crossfeed issues! One RL-10 off on the final orbit insertion stage, it's fine. 211x213 km orbit, 0.20 degree error from escape stage. Shut down one engine on final insertion. Needed to enable crossfeed on fairing adapter to get front RCS to work. Docking 10 hours and 54 minutes after launch. Tanker out of fuel, leaving it as debris, along with it's final insertion stage. 88.5 kL LH2, left 900 L in the tanker to deorbit, well now I can't deorbit."
1968 Nov 23 08:17,2025 Jul 22,Colussus 2 BHH-23,Polaris 6 Crew,First Human Moon Landing,"Roman Nesterov, Otto Kaiser",,"88.5 kL LH2 in the escape stage gives us 3600 m/s. The Mini Tanker is not needed and can be repurposed for some other high dV mission.        5 degrees off at launch, heading change began during first stage burn. Down to 0.28 before core stage burnout.        22 tons of spacecraft and only 20 tons avionics. How was this missed? Docking 3 hours 41 minutes after launch."
